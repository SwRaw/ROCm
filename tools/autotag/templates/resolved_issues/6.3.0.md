### Bandwidth limitation in gang and non-gang modes on Instinct MI300A

Fixed an issue where expected target peak non-gang performance (~60 GB/s) and target peak gang
performance (~90 GB/s) were not achieved. Previously, both gang and non-gang performance were
observed to be limited at 45 GB/s. See [issue #3496](https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/issues/3496) on
GitHub.
