- The default build removes device code for gfx803 architecture from the fat binary

##### Fixed

- Make offset calculations for rocBLAS functions 64 bit safe. Fixes for very large leading dimension or increment potentially causing overflow:
  - Level2: gbmv, gemv, hbmv, sbmv, spmv, tbmv, tpmv, tbsv, tpsv
- Lazy loading to support heterogeneous architecture setup and load appropriate tensile library files based on the device&#39;s architecture
- Guard against no-op kernel launches resulting in potential hipGetLastError

##### Changed

- Default verbosity of rocblas-test reduced. To see all tests set environment variable GTEST_LISTENER=PASS_LINE_IN_LOG

#### rocFFT 1.0.25

rocFFT 1.0.25 for ROCm 6.0.0

##### Added

- Implemented experimental APIs to allow computing FFTs on data distributed across multiple devices in a single process.

  `rocfft_field` is a new type that can be added to a plan description, to describe layout of FFT input or output.  `rocfft_field_add_brick` can be called one or more times to describe a brick decomposition of an FFT field, where each brick can be assigned a different device.

  These interfaces are still experimental and subject to change.  We are interested to hear feedback on them.  Questions and concerns may be raised by opening issues on the [rocFFT issue tracker](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/rocFFT/issues).

  Note that at this time, multi-device FFTs have several limitations:

  * Real-complex (forward or inverse) FFTs are not currently supported.
  * Planar format fields are not currently supported.
  * Batch (i.e. `number_of_transforms` provided to `rocfft_plan_create`) must be 1.
  * The FFT input is gathered to the current device at execute time, so all of the FFT data must fit on that device.

  We expect these limitations to be removed in future releases.

##### Optimizations

- Improved performance of some small 2D/3D real FFTs supported by 2D_SINGLE kernel. gfx90a gets more optimization
  by offline tuning.
- Removed an extra kernel launch from even-length real-complex FFTs that use callbacks.

##### Changed

- Built kernels in solution-map to library kernel cache.
- Real forward transforms (real-to-complex) no longer overwrite input.  rocFFT still may overwrite real inverse (complex-to-real) input, as this allows for faster performance.

- rocfft-rider and dyna-rocfft-rider have been renamed to rocfft-bench and dyna-rocfft-bench, controlled by the
  BUILD_CLIENTS_BENCH CMake option.  Links for the old file names are installed, and the old
  BUILD_CLIENTS_RIDER CMake option is accepted for compatibility but both will be removed in a future release.
- Binaries in debug builds no longer have a &#34;-d&#34; suffix.

##### Fixed

- rocFFT now correctly handles load callbacks that convert data from a smaller data type (e.g. 16-bit integers -&gt; 32-bit float).

#### rocm-cmake 0.11.0

rocm-cmake 0.11.0 for ROCm 6.0.0

##### Changed

- ROCMSphinxDoc: Improved validation, documentation and rocm-docs-core integration.

##### Fixed

- ROCMClangTidy: Fixed extra make flags passed for clang tidy.
- ROCMTest: Fixed issues when using module in a subdirectory.

#### rocPRIM 3.0.0

rocPRIM 3.0.0 for ROCm 6.0.0

##### Added

- `block_sort::sort()` overload for keys and values with a dynamic size, for all block sort algorithms. Additionally, all `block_sort::sort()` overloads with a dynamic size are now supported for `block_sort_algorithm::merge_sort` and `block_sort_algorithm::bitonic_sort`.
- New two-way partition primitive `partition_two_way` which can write to two separate iterators.

##### Optimizations

- Improved the performance of `partition`.

##### Fixed

- Fixed `rocprim::MatchAny` for devices with 64-bit warp size. The function `rocprim::MatchAny` is deprecated and `rocprim::match_any` is preferred instead.

#### rocRAND 2.10.17

rocRAND 2.10.17 for ROCm 6.0.0

##### Added

- MT19937 pseudo random number generator based on M. Matsumoto and T. Nishimura, 1998, Mersenne Twister: A 623-dimensionally equidistributed uniform pseudorandom number generator.
- New benchmark for the device API using Google Benchmark, `benchmark_rocrand_device_api`, replacing `benchmark_rocrand_kernel`. `benchmark_rocrand_kernel` is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Likewise, `benchmark_curand_host_api` is added to replace `benchmark_curand_generate` and `benchmark_curand_device_api` is added to replace `benchmark_curand_kernel`.
- experimental HIP-CPU feature
- ThreeFry pseudorandom number generator based on Salmon et al., 2011, &#34;Parallel random numbers: as easy as 1, 2, 3&#34;.
- Accessor methods for sobol 32 and 64 direction vectors and constants:
  - Enum `rocrand_direction_vector_set` to select the direction vector set.
  - `rocrand_get_direction_vectors32(...)` supersedes:
    - `rocrand_h_sobol32_direction_vectors` 
    - `rocrand_h_scrambled_sobol32_direction_vectors`
  - `rocrand_get_direction_vectors64(...)` supersedes:
    - `rocrand_h_sobol64_direction_vectors` 
    - `rocrand_h_scrambled_sobol64_direction_vectors`
  - `rocrand_get_scramble_constants32(...)` supersedes `h_scrambled_sobol32_constants`

- Fixed bug where passing nnz = 0 to doti or dotci did not always return a dot product of 0

#### rocThrust 3.0.0

rocThrust 3.0.0 for ROCm 6.0.0

##### Added

- Updated to match upstream Thrust 2.0.1
- NV_IF_TARGET macro from libcu++ for NVIDIA backend and HIP implementation for HIP backend.

##### Changed

- The cmake build system now additionally accepts `GPU_TARGETS` in addition to `AMDGPU_TARGETS` for
  setting the targeted gpu architectures. `GPU_TARGETS=all` will compile for all supported architectures.

##### Removed

- Removed cub symlink from the root of the repository.
- Removed support for deprecated macros (THRUST_DEVICE_BACKEND and THRUST_HOST_BACKEND).

##### Known Issues

- For NVIDIA backend, `NV_IF_TARGET` and `THRUST_RDC_ENABLED` intend to substitute the `THRUST_HAS_CUDART` macro, which is now no longer used in Thrust (provided for legacy support only). However, there is no `THRUST_RDC_ENABLED` macro available for the HIP backend, so some branches in Thrust&#39;s code may be unreachable in the HIP backend.
