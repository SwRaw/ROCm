## Release highlights

The following are notable new features and improvements in ROCm 6.3.0. For changes to individual components, see
[Detailed component changes](#detailed-component-changes).

### rocJPEG added

ROCm 6.3.0 introduces the rocJPEG library to the ROCm software stack. rocJPEG is a high performance
JPEG decode SDK for AMD GPUs. For more information, see the [rocJPEG
documentation](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocJPEG/en/docs-6.3.0/index.html).

### ROCm Compute Profiler and ROCm Systems Profiler

These ROCm components have been renamed to reflect their new direction as part of the ROCm software
stack.

- **ROCm Compute Profiler**, formerly Omniperf. For more information, see the [ROCm Compute Profiler
  documentation](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocprofiler-compute/en/docs-6.3.0/index.html) and
  [https://github.com/ROCm/rocprofiler-compute](https://github.com/ROCm/rocprofiler-compute) on GitHub.

- **ROCm Systems Profiler**, formerly Omnitrace. For more information, see the [ROCm Systems Profiler
  documentation](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocprofiler-systems/en/docs-6.3.0/index.html) and
  [https://github.com/ROCm/rocprofiler-systems](https://github.com/ROCm/rocprofiler-systems) on GitHub.
  For future compatibility, the Omnitrace project is available at [https://github.com/ROCm/omnitrace](https://github.com/ROCm/omnitrace).
  See the [Omnitrace documentation](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/omnitrace/en/latest/index.html).

  ```{note}
  Update any references to the old binary names `omniperf` and `omnitrace` to
  ensure compatibility with the new `rocprof-compute` and `rocprof-sys-*` binaries.
  This might include updating environment variables, commands, and paths as
  needed to avoid disruptions to your profiling or tracing workflows.

  See [ROCm Compute Profiler 3.0.0](#rocm-compute-profiler-3-0-0) and [ROCm Systems
  Profiler 0.1.0](#rocm-systems-profiler-0-1-0).
  ```

### SHARK AI toolkit for high-speed inferencing and serving introduced

SHARK is an open-source toolkit for high-performance serving of popular generative AI and large
language models. In its initial release, SHARK contains the [Shortfin high-performance serving
engine](https://github.com/nod-ai/shark-ai/tree/main/shortfin), which is the SHARK inferencing
library that includes example server applications for popular models.

This initial release includes support for serving the Stable Diffusion XL model on AMD Instinct™
MI300 devices using ROCm. See the SHARK [release
page](https://github.com/nod-ai/shark-ai/releases/tag/v3.0.0) on GitHub to get started.

### PyTorch 2.4 support added

ROCm 6.3.0 adds support for PyTorch 2.4. See the [Compatibility
matrix](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/docs-6.3.0/compatibility/compatibility-matrix.html#framework-support-compatibility-matrix)
for the complete list of PyTorch versions tested for compatibility with ROCm.

### Flash Attention kernels in Triton and Composable Kernel (CK) added to Transformer Engine

Composable Kernel-based and Triton-based Flash Attention kernels have been integrated into
Transformer Engine via the ROCm Composable Kernel and AOTriton libraries. The
Transformer Engine can now optionally select a flexible and optimized Attention
solution for AMD GPUs. For more information, see [Fused Attention Backends on
ROCm](https://github.com/ROCm/TransformerEngine/tree/dev?tab=readme-ov-file#fused-attention-backends-on-rocm)
on GitHub.

### HIP compatibility

HIP now includes the `hipStreamLegacy` API. It's equivalent to NVIDIA `cudaStreamLegacy`. For more
information, see [Global enum and
defines](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/HIP/en/docs-6.3.0/reference/hip_runtime_api/global_defines_enums_structs_files/global_enum_and_defines.html#c.hipStreamLegacy)
in the HIP runtime API documentation.

### Unload active amdgpu-dkms module without a system reboot

On Instinct MI200 and MI300 systems, you can now unload the active `amdgpu-dkms` modules, and reinstall
and reload newer modules without a system reboot. If the new `dkms` package includes newer firmware
components, the driver will first reset the device and then load newer firmware components.

### ROCm Offline Installer Creator updates

The ROCm Offline Installer Creator 6.3 introduces a new feature to uninstall the previous version of
ROCm on the non-connected target system before installing a new version. This feature is only supported
on the Ubuntu distribution. See the [ROCm Offline Installer
Creator](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/docs-6.3.0/install/rocm-offline-installer.html)
documentation for more information.

### OpenCL ICD loader separated from ROCm

The OpenCL ICD loader is no longer delivered as part of ROCm, and must be installed separately
as part of the [ROCm installation
process](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/docs-6.3.0). For Ubuntu and RHEL
installations, the required package is installed as part of the setup described in
[Prerequisites](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/docs-6.3.0/install/prerequisites.html).
In other supported Linux distributions like SUSE, the required package must be installed in separate steps, which are included in the installation instructions.

Because the OpenCL path is now separate from the ROCm installation for versioned and multi-version
installations, you must manually define the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point to the ROCm
installation library as described in the [Post-installation
instructions](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/docs-6.3.0/install/post-install.html).
If the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is not set as needed for versioned or multi-version installations, OpenCL
applications like `clinfo` will fail to run and return an error.

### ROCT Thunk Interface integrated into ROCr runtime

The ROCT Thunk Interface package is now integrated into the ROCr runtime. As a result, the ROCT package
is no longer included as a separate package in the ROCm software stack.

### ROCm documentation updates

ROCm documentation continues to be updated to provide clearer and more comprehensive guidance for a
wider variety of user needs and use cases.

- Documentation for Tensile is now available. Tensile is a library that creates
  benchmark-driven backend implementations for GEMMs, serving primarily as a
  backend component of rocBLAS. See the [Tensile
  documentation](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/Tensile/en/docs-6.3.0/src/index.html).

- New documentation has been added to explain the advantages of enabling the IOMMU in passthrough
  mode for Instinct accelerators and Radeon GPUs. See [Input-Output Memory Management
  Unit](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/docs-6.3.0/conceptual/iommu.html).

## Detailed component changes

The following sections describe key changes to ROCm components.

### **AMD SMI** (24.7.1)

#### Added

- Support for `amd-smi metric --ecc` & `amd-smi metric --ecc-blocks` on Guest VMs.

- Support for GPU metrics 1.6 to `amdsmi_get_gpu_metrics_info()`

- New violation status outputs and APIs: `amdsmi_status_t amdsmi_get_violation_status()`, `amd-smi metric  --throttle`, and `amd-smi monitor --violation`. This feature is only available on MI300+ ASICs

- Ability to view XCP (Graphics Compute Partition) activity within `amd-smi metric --usage`. Partition-specific features are only available on MI300+ ASICs

- Added `LC_PERF_OTHER_END_RECOVERY` CLI output to `amd-smi metric --pcie` and updated `amdsmi_get_pcie_info()` to include this value. This feature is only available on MI300+ ASICs

- Ability to retrieve a set of GPUs that are nearest to a given device at a specific link type level
  - Added `amdsmi_get_link_topology_nearest()` function to amd-smi C and Python Libraries.

- More supported utilization count types to `amdsmi_get_utilization_count()`

- `amd-smi set -L/--clk-limit ...` command. This is equivalent to rocm-smi's `--extremum` command which sets sclk's or mclk's soft minimum or soft maximum clock frequency.

- Unittest functionality to test `amdsmi` API calls in Python

- GPU memory overdrive percentage to `amd-smi metric -o`
  - Added `amdsmi_get_gpu_mem_overdrive_level()` function to AMD SMI C and Python Libraries.

- Ability to retrieve connection type and P2P capabilities between two GPUs
  - Added `amdsmi_topo_get_p2p_status()` function to amd-smi C and Python Libraries.
  - Added retrieving P2P link capabilities to CLI `amd-smi topology`.

- New `amdsmi_kfd_info_t` type and added information under `amd-smi list`

- Subsystem device ID to `amd-smi static --asic`. There are no underlying changes to `amdsmi_get_gpu_asic_info`.

- `Target_Graphics_Version` to `amd-smi static --asic` and `amdsmi_get_gpu_asic_info()`.

#### Changed

- Updated BDF commands to use KFD SYSFS for BDF: `amdsmi_get_gpu_device_bdf()`. This change aligns BDF output with ROCm SMI.

- Moved Python tests directory path install location.
  - `/opt/<rocm-path>/share/amd_smi/pytest/..` to `/opt/<rocm-path>/share/amd_smi/tests/python_unittest/..`
  - Removed PyTest dependency. Python testing now depends on the unittest framework only.

- Changed the `power` parameter in `amdsmi_get_energy_count()` to `energy_accumulator`.
  - Changes propagate forwards into the Python interface as well. Backwards compatibility is maintained.

- Updated Partition APIs and struct information and added `partition_id` to `amd-smi static --partition`.
  - As part of an overhaul to partition information, some partition information will be made available in the `amdsmi_accelerator_partition_profile_t`.
  - This struct will be filled out by a new API, `amdsmi_get_gpu_accelerator_partition_profile()`.
  - Future data from these APIs will eventually be added to `amd-smi partition`.

#### Removed

- `amd-smi reset --compute-partition` and `... --memory-partition` and associated APIs
  - This change is part of the partition redesign. Reset functionality will be reintroduced in a later update.
  - Associated APIs include `amdsmi_reset_gpu_compute_partition()` and `amdsmi_reset_gpu_memory_partition()`

- Usage of `_validate_positive` is removed in parser and replaced with `_positive_int` and `_not_negative_int` as appropriate.
  - This will allow `0` to be a valid input for several options in setting CPUs where appropriate (for example, as a mode or NBIOID).

#### Optimized

- Adjusted ordering of `gpu_metrics` calls to ensure that `pcie_bw` values remain stable in `amd-smi metric` & `amd-smi monitor`.
  - With this change additional padding was added to `PCIE_BW` `amd-smi monitor --pcie`

#### Known issues

- See [AMD SMI manual build issue](#amd-smi-manual-build-issue).

#### Resolved issues

- Improved Offline install process and lowered dependency for PyYAML.

- Fixed CPX not showing total number of logical GPUs.

- Fixed incorrect implementation of the Python API `amdsmi_get_gpu_metrics_header_info()`.

- `amdsmitst` `TestGpuMetricsRead` now prints metric in correct units.

#### Upcoming changes

- Python API for `amdsmi_get_energy_count()` will deprecate the `power` field in a future ROCm release and use `energy_accumulator` field instead.

- New memory and compute partition APIs will be added in a future ROCm release.
  - These APIs will be updated to fully populate the CLI and allowing compute (accelerator) partitions to be set by profile ID.
  - One API will be provided, to reset both memory and compute (accelerator).
  - The following APIs will remain:

    ```C
    amdsmi_status_t
    amdsmi_set_gpu_compute_partition(amdsmi_processor_handle processor_handle,
                                      amdsmi_compute_partition_type_t compute_partition);
    amdsmi_status_t
    amdsmi_get_gpu_compute_partition(amdsmi_processor_handle processor_handle,
                                      char *compute_partition, uint32_t len);
    amdsmi_status_t
    amdsmi_get_gpu_memory_partition(amdsmi_processor_handle processor_handle,

                                      char *memory_partition, uint32_t len);

                                      amdsmi_memory_partition_type_t memory_partition);
    ```

- `amd-smi set --compute-partition "SPX/DPX/CPX..."` will no longer be supported in a future ROCm release.
  - This is due to aligning with Host setups and providing more robust partition information through the APIs outlined above. Furthermore, new APIs which will be available on both BM/Host can set by profile ID.

- Added a preliminary `amd-smi partition` command.
  - The new partition command can display GPU information, including memory and accelerator partition information.
  - The command will be at full functionality once additional partition information from `amdsmi_get_gpu_accelerator_partition_profile()` has been implemented.

    - `hipHostAlloc`
    - `hipFreeHost`

#### Optimized

* Disabled CPU wait in device synchronize to avoid idle time in applications such as Hugging Face models and PyTorch.
* Optimized multi-threaded dispatches to improve performance.
* Limited the software batch size to control the number of command submissions for runtime to handle efficiently.
* Optimizes HSA callback performance when a large number of events are recorded by multiple threads and submitted to multiple GPUs.

* Memory leak in the API `hipGraphInstantiate` when kernel is launched using `hipExtLaunchKernelGGL` with event.
* Memory leak when the API `hipGraphAddMemAllocNode` is called.
* The `_sync()` version of crosslane builtins such as `shfl_sync()`,
  `__all_sync()` and `__any_sync()`, continue to be hidden behind the
  preprocessor macro `HIP_ENABLE_WARP_SYNC_BUILTINS`, and will be enabled
  unconditionally in the next ROCm release.

#### Upcoming changes

* Deprecated HIP APIs:
    - `hipHostMalloc` to be replaced by `hipExtHostAlloc`.
    - `hipHostFree` to be replaced by `hipFreeHost`.

### **hipBLAS** (2.3.0)

#### Added

* Level 3 functions have an additional `ILP64` API for both C and Fortran (`_64` name suffix) with `int64_t` function arguments

#### Changed

* `amdclang` is used as the default compiler instead of `g++`.
* Added a dependency on the `hipblas-common` package.

### **hipCUB** (3.3.0)

#### Added

* Support for large indices in `hipcub::DeviceSegmentedReduce::*` has been added, with the exception
  of `DeviceSegmentedReduce::Arg*`. Although rocPRIM's backend provides support for all reduce
  variants, CUB does not support large indices in `DeviceSegmentedReduce::Arg*`. For this reason,
  large index support is not available for `hipcub::DeviceSegmentedReduce::Arg*`.

#### Changed

* Changed the default value of `rmake.py -a` to `default_gpus`. This is equivalent to `gfx906:xnack-,gfx1030,gfx1100,gfx1101,gfx1102`.
* The NVIDIA backend now requires CUB, Thrust, and libcu++ 2.3.2.

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed an issue in `rmake.py` where the list storing cmake options would contain individual characters instead of a full string of options.
* Fixed an issue where `config.hpp` was not included in all hipCUB headers, resulting in build errors.

### **hipFFT** (1.0.17)

#### Changed

* The AMD backend is now compiled using amdclang++ instead of hipcc. The NVIDIA CUDA backend still uses hipcc-nvcc.
* CLI11 replaces Boost Program Options as the command line parser for clients.
* Building with the address sanitizer option sets xnack+ for the relevant GPU architectures.

### **hipfort** (0.5.0)

### **hipRAND** (2.11.0[*](#id22))

#### Changed

* Updated the default value for the `-a` argument from `rmake.py` to `gfx906:xnack-,gfx1030,gfx1100,gfx1101,gfx1102`.

#### Known issues

* In ROCm 6.3.0, the hipRAND package version is incorrectly set to `2.11.0`. In ROCm
  6.2.4, the hipRAND package version was `2.11.1`. The hipRAND version number will be corrected in a
  future ROCm release.

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed an issue in `rmake.py` where the list storing the CMake options would contain individual characters instead of a full string of options.

### **hipSOLVER** (2.3.0)

#### Added

* Auxiliary functions:
    * `hipsolverSetDeterministicMode`, `hipsolverGetDeterministicMode`
* Compatibility-only functions:
  * `potrf`

    * `hipsolverDnXpotrf`
  * `potrs`
    * `hipsolverDnXpotrs`
  * `geqrf`
    * `hipsolverDnXgeqrf_bufferSize`
    * `hipsolverDnXgeqrf`

#### Changed

* Binaries in debug builds no longer have a `-d` suffix.
* Changed rocSPARSE and SuiteSparse to be runtime dependencies by default. The `BUILD_WITH_SPARSE` CMake option can still be used
  to convert them into build-time dependencies (now off by default).
* The `--no-sparse` option for the install script now only affects the hipSOLVER clients and their dependency on hipSPARSE. Use the
  `BUILD_HIPSPARSE_TESTS` CMake option to enable tests for the `hipsolverSp` API (on by default).

#### Upcoming changes

* The Fortran bindings provided in `hipsolver_module.f90` have been deprecated.
  The Fortran bindings provided by the hipfort project are recommended instead.

### **hipSPARSE** (3.1.2)

#### Added

* Improved the user documentation.

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed the gfortran dependency for the Azure Linux operating system.

#### Known issues

* In `hipsparseSpSM_solve()`, the external buffer is passed as a parameter. This does not match the NVIDIA CUDA cuSPARSE API. This extra external buffer parameter will be removed in a future release. For now, this extra parameter can be ignored and `nullptr` passed as it is unused internally by `hipsparseSpSM_solve()`.

### **hipSPARSELt** (0.2.2)

#### Added

* Support for a new data type combination: `INT8` inputs, `BF16` output, and `INT32` Matrix Core accumulation
* Support for row-major memory order (`HIPSPARSE_ORDER_ROW`)

#### Changed

* Changed the default compiler to amdclang++.

#### Upcoming changes

* `hipsparseLtDatatype_t` is deprecated and will be removed in the next major release of ROCm. `hipDataType` should be used instead.

### **hipTensor** (1.4.0)

#### Added

* Added support for tensor reduction, including APIs, CPU reference, unit tests, and documentation

#### Changed

* ASAN builds only support xnack+ targets.
* ASAN builds use `-mcmodel=large` to accommodate library sizes greater than 2GB.
* Updated the permute backend to accommodate changes to element-wise operations.
* Updated the actor-critic implementation.
* Various documentation formatting updates.

#### Optimized

* Split kernel instances to improve build times.

#### Resolved issues

### **rocFFT** (1.0.31)

#### Added

* rocfft-test now includes a `--smoketest` option.
* Implemented experimental APIs to allow computing FFTs on data
  distributed across multiple MPI ranks. These APIs can be enabled with the
  `ROCFFT_MPI_ENABLE` CMake option.  This option defaults to `OFF`.

  When `ROCFFT_MPI_ENABLE` is `ON`:

  * `rocfft_plan_description_set_comm` can be called to provide an
    MPI communicator to a plan description, which can then be passed
    to `rocfft_plan_create`.  Each rank calls
    `rocfft_field_add_brick` to specify the layout of data bricks on
    that rank.

  * An MPI library with ROCm acceleration enabled is required at
    build time and at runtime.

#### Changed

* Compilation uses amdclang++ instead of hipcc.
* CLI11 replaces Boost Program Options as the command line parser for clients and samples.

- Support for precise ALU exception reporting for supported architectures. Precise ALU exceptions reporting is controlled with the following commands:
  - `set amdgpu precise-alu-exceptions`
  - `show amdgpu precise-alu-exceptions`

#### Changed

- The `sysroot` or `solib-search-path` settings can now be used to locate files containing GPU code objects when opening a core dump. This allows opening GPU code objects on systems different from the one where the core dump was generated.

#### Resolved issues

- Fixed possible hangs when opening some AMDGPU core dumps in ROCgdb.
- Addressed cases where the `roccoremerge` utility improperly handled LOAD segment copy from the host core dump to the combined core dump.

### **ROCm Compute Profiler** (3.0.0)

#### Changed

* Renamed to ROCm Compute Profiler from Omniperf.
  * New package name: `rocprofiler-compute`

### **ROCm SMI** (7.4.0)

#### Added

- **Added `rsmi_dev_memory_partition_capabilities_get` which returns driver memory partition capablities.**  
Driver now has the ability to report what the user can set memory partition modes to. User can now see available
memory partition modes upon an invalid argument return from memory partition mode set (`rsmi_dev_memory_partition_set`).

- Support for GPU metrics 1.6 to `rsmi_dev_gpu_metrics_info_get()`. Updated
  `rsmi_dev_gpu_metrics_info_get()` and structure `rsmi_gpu_metrics_t` to include new fields for
  PVIOL / TVIOL, XCP (Graphics Compute Partitions) stats, and `pcie_lc_perf_other_end_recovery`.

- Ability to view raw GPU metrics using `rocm-smi --showmetrics`.

#### Changed

- Added back in C++ tests for `memorypartition_read_write`

- Updated `rsmi_dev_memory_partition_set` to not return until a successful restart of AMD GPU Driver.

- All APIs now have the ability to catch driver reporting invalid arguments.

#### Removals

- Removed `--resetcomputepartition`, and  `--resetmemorypartition` options and associated APIs.
  - This change is part of the partition feature redesign.
  - The related APIs `rsmi_dev_compute_partition_reset()` and `rsmi_dev_memory_partition_reset()`.

#### Resolved issues

- Fixed `rsmi_dev_target_graphics_version_get`, `rocm-smi --showhw`, and `rocm-smi --showprod` not displaying properly for MI2x or Navi 3x ASICs.

#### Upcoming changes

- Babel parameters made runtime configurable.

#### Known issues

- See [ROCm Validation Suite needs specified configuration file](#rocm-validation-suite-needs-specified-configuration-file).

### **rocPRIM** (3.3.0)

#### Added

* The `--test smoke` option has been added to `rtest.py`. When `rtest.py` is called with this option it runs a subset of tests such that the total test time is 5 minutes. Use `python3 ./rtest.py --test smoke` or `python3 ./rtest.py -t smoke` to run the smoke test.
* The `--seed` option has been added to `run_benchmarks.py`. The `--seed` option specifies a seed for the generation of random inputs. When the option is omitted, the default behavior is to use a random seed for each benchmark measurement.
* Added configuration autotuning to device partition (`rocprim::partition`, `rocprim::partition_two_way`, and `rocprim::partition_three_way`), to device select (`rocprim::select`, `rocprim::unique`, and `rocprim::unique_by_key`), and to device reduce by key (`rocprim::reduce_by_key`) to improve performance on selected architectures.
* Added `rocprim::uninitialized_array` to provide uninitialized storage in local memory for user-defined types.
* Added large segment support for `rocprim:segmented_reduce`.
* Added a parallel `nth_element` device function similar to `std::nth_element`. `nth_element` places elements that are smaller than the nth element before the nth element, and elements that are bigger than the nth element after the nth element.
* Added deterministic (bitwise reproducible) algorithm variants `rocprim::deterministic_inclusive_scan`, `rocprim::deterministic_exclusive_scan`, `rocprim::deterministic_inclusive_scan_by_key`, `rocprim::deterministic_exclusive_scan_by_key`, and `rocprim::deterministic_reduce_by_key`. These provide run-to-run stable results with non-associative operators such as float operations, at the cost of reduced performance.
* Added a parallel `partial_sort` and `partial_sort_copy` device functions similar to `std::partial_sort` and `std::partial_sort_copy`. `partial_sort` and `partial_sort_copy` arrange elements such that the elements are in the same order as a sorted list up to and including the middle index.

#### Changed

* Changed the default value of `rmake.py -a` to `default_gpus`. This is equivalent to `gfx906:xnack-,gfx1030,gfx1100,gfx1101,gfx1102`.
* Modified the input size in device adjacent difference benchmarks. Observed performance with these benchmarks might be different.
* Changed the default seed for `device_benchmark_segmented_reduce`.

#### Removed

* `rocprim::thread_load()` and `rocprim::thread_store()` have been deprecated. Use `dereference()` instead.

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed an issue in `rmake.py` where the list storing cmake options would contain individual characters instead of a full string of options.
* Resolved an issue in `rtest.py` where it crashed if the `build` folder was created without `release` or `debug` subdirectories.
* Resolved an issue with `rtest.py` on Windows where passing an absolute path to `--install_dir` caused a `FileNotFound` error.
* rocPRIM functions are no longer forcefully inlined on Windows. This significantly reduces the build time of debug builds.
* `block_load`, `block_store`, `block_shuffle`, `block_exchange`, and `warp_exchange` now use placement `new` instead of copy assignment (`operator=`) when writing to local memory. This fixes the behavior of custom types with non-trivial copy assignments.
* Fixed a bug in the generation of input data for benchmarks, which caused incorrect performance to be reported in specific cases. It may affect the reported performance for one-byte types (`uint8_t` and `int8_t`) and instantiations of `custom_type`. Specifically, device binary search, device histogram, device merge and warp sort are affected.
* Fixed a bug for `rocprim::merge_path_search` where using `unsigned` offsets would produce incorrect results.
* Fixed a bug for `rocprim::thread_load` and `rocprim::thread_store` where `float` and `double` were not cast to the correct type, resulting in incorrect results.
* Resolved an issue where tests were failing when they were compiled with `-D_GLIBCXX_ASSERTIONS=ON`.
* Resolved an issue where algorithms that used an internal serial merge routine caused a memory access fault that resulted in potential performance drops when using block sort, device merge sort (block merge), device merge, device partial sort, and device sort (merge sort).
* Fixed memory leaks in unit tests due to missing calls to `hipFree()` and the incorrect use of hipGraphs.
* Fixed an issue where certain inputs to `block_sort_merge()`, `device_merge_sort_merge_path()`, `device_merge()`, and `warp_sort_stable()` caused an assertion error during the call to `serial_merge()`.

### **ROCProfiler** (2.0.0)

#### Added

- JSON output plugin for `rocprofv2`. The JSON file matches Google Trace Format making it easy to load on Perfetto, Chrome tracing, or Speedscope. For Speedscope, use `--disable-json-data-flows` option as speedscope doesn't work with data flows.
- `--no-serialization` flag to disable kernel serialization when `rocprofv2` is in counter collection mode. This allows `rocprofv2` to avoid deadlock when profiling certain programs in counter collection mode.
- `FP64_ACTIVE` and `ENGINE_ACTIVE` metrics to AMD Instinct MI300 accelerator
- New HIP APIs with struct defined inside union.
- Early checks to confirm the eligibility of ELF file in ATT plugin

- The hang issue of `ProfilerAPITest` of `runFeatureTests` on AMD Instinct MI300 accelerator
- Segmentation fault on Navi32


### **ROCprofiler-SDK** (0.5.0)

#### Added

- Start and end timestamp columns to the counter collection `csv` output
- Check to force tools to initialize context id with zero
- Support to specify hardware counters for collection using `rocprofv3` as `rocprofv3 --pmc [COUNTER [COUNTER ...]]`

  ```
  find . -type f -exec sed -i 's/rocprofiler_agent_profile_callback_t/rocprofiler_device_counting_service_callback_t/g; s/rocprofiler_configure_agent_profile_counting_service/rocprofiler_configure_device_counting_service/g; s/agent_profile.h/device_counting_service.h/g; s/rocprofiler_sample_agent_profile_counting_service/rocprofiler_sample_device_counting_service/g' {} +
  ```
- Changed naming of "dispatch profiling service" to a more descriptive "dispatch counting service". To convert existing tool or user code to the new names, the following sed can be used:
  ```
  -type f -exec sed -i -e 's/dispatch_profile_counting_service/dispatch_counting_service/g' -e 's/dispatch_profile.h/dispatch_counting_service.h/g' -e 's/rocprofiler_profile_counting_dispatch_callback_t/rocprofiler_dispatch_counting_service_callback_t/g' -e 's/rocprofiler_profile_counting_dispatch_data_t/rocprofiler_dispatch_counting_service_data_t/g'  -e 's/rocprofiler_profile_counting_dispatch_record_t/rocprofiler_dispatch_counting_service_record_t/g' {} +
  ```

## ROCm known issues

ROCm known issues are noted on {fab}`github` [GitHub](https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/labels/Verified%20Issue). For known
issues related to individual components, review the [Detailed component changes](#detailed-component-changes).

### Instinct MI300X reports incorrect raw GPU timestamps

On MI300X accelerators, the command processor firmware reports incorrect raw GPU timestamps. This
issue is under investigation and will be addressed in a future release. See [GitHub issue #4079](https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/issues/4079).

### Instinct MI300 series: backward weights convolution performance issue

A performance issue affects certain tensor shapes during backward weights convolution when using
FP16 or FP32 data types on Instinct MI300 series accelerators. This issue will be addressed in a future ROCm release.
See [GitHub issue #4080](https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/issues/4080).

To mitigate the issue during model training, set the following environment variables:

```bash
export MIOPEN_FIND_MODE=3
export MIOPEN_FIND_ENFORCE=3
```

These settings enable auto-tuning on the first occurrence of a new tensor shape. The tuning results
are stored in the user database, eliminating the need for repeated tuning when the same shape is
encountered in subsequent runs. See the
[MIOpen](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/how-to/tuning-guides/mi300x/workload.html#miopen)
section in the workload optimization guide to learn more about the MIOpen auto-tuning capabilities.

### TransferBench package not functional

TransferBench packages included in the ROCm 6.3.0 release are not compiled properly and are not
functional for most GPU targets, except for gfx906. Full functionality will be available
in a future ROCm release. See [GitHub issue #4081](https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/issues/4081).

TransferBench is a utility for benchmarking simultaneous transfers between user-specified devices
(CPUs or GPUs). See the documentation at [TransferBench
documentation](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/TransferBench/en/docs-6.3.0/index.html). If you
want to use TransferBench, access the properly compiled packages at
[https://github.com/ROCm/TransferBench/releases](https://github.com/ROCm/TransferBench/releases).

### ROCm Compute Profiler post-upgrade

In ROCm 6.3.0, the `omniperf` package is now named `rocprofiler-compute`. As a result, running `apt install omniperf` will fail to locate the package.
Instead, use `apt install rocprofiler-compute`. See [ROCm Compute Profiler 3.0.0](#rocm-compute-profiler-3-0-0).

When upgrading from ROCm 6.2 to 6.3, any existing `/opt/rocm-6.2/../omniperf` folders are not
automatically removed. To clean up these folders, manually uninstall Omniperf using `apt remove omniperf`.
See [GitHub issue #4082](https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/issues/4082).

### ROCm Systems Profiler post-upgrade

In ROCm 6.3.0, the `omnitrace` package is now named `rocprofiler-systems`. As a result, running `apt install omnitrace` will fail to locate the package.
Instead, use `apt install rocprofiler-systems`. See [ROCm Systems Profiler 0.1.0](#rocm-systems-profiler-0-1-0).

When upgrading from ROCm 6.2 to 6.3, any existing `/opt/rocm-6.2/../omnitrace` folders are not
automatically removed. To clean up these folders, manually uninstall Omnitrace using `apt remove omnitrace`.
See [GitHub issue #4083](https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/issues/4083).

### Stale file due to OpenCL ICD loader deprecation

When upgrading from ROCm 6.2.x to ROCm 6.3.0, the [removal of the `rocm-icd-loader`
package](#opencl-icd-loader-separated-from-rocm) leaves a stale file in the old `rocm-6.2.x`
directory. This has no functional impact. As a workaround, manually uninstall the
`rocm-icd-loader` package to remove the stale file. This issue will be addressed in a future ROCm
release. See [GitHub issue #4084](https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/issues/4084).

### ROCm Compute Profiler CTest failure in CI

When running ROCm Compute Profiler's (`rocprof-compute`) CTest in the Azure CI environment, the
`rocprof-compute` execution test fails. This issue is due to an outdated test file that was not renamed
(`omniperf` to `rocprof-compute`), and due to the `ROCM_PATH` environment variable not being set in
the Azure CI environment, causing the tool to be unable to extract chip information as expected.
This issue will be addressed in a future ROCm release. See [GitHub issue #4085](https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/issues/4085).

### MIVisionX memory access fault in Canny edge detection

Canny edge detection kernels might access out-of-bounds memory locations while
computing gradient intensities on edge pixels. This issue is isolated to
Canny-specific use cases on Instinct MI300 series accelerators. This issue is
resolved in the [MIVisionX `develop` branch](https://github.com/ROCm/mivisionx)
and will be part of a future ROCm release. See [GitHub issue #4086](https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/issues/4086).

### Transformer Engine test_distributed_fused_attn aborts with fatal Python error

The `test_distributed_fused_attn` Pytest case for JAX in [Transformer Engine
for ROCm](https://github.com/ROCm/TransformerEngine) fails with a fatal Python
error under certain conditions. The root cause is unrelated Transformer Engine
but due to some issue within XLA. This XLA issue is under investigation and
will be addressed in a future release. See [GitHub issue #4087](https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/issues/4087).

### AMD SMI manual build issue

Manual builds of AMD SMI fail due to a broken link in its build configuration.
This affects past AMD SMI releases as well. The fix is underway and will be
applied to all branches at [https://github.com/ROCm/amdsmi](https://github.com/ROCm/amdsmi).
See [GitHub issue #4088](https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/issues/4088).

### ROCm Data Center Tool incorrect RHEL9 package version

In previous versions of ROCm Data Center Tool (RDC) included with ROCm 6.2 for RHEL9, RDC's version
number was incorrectly set to `1.0.0`. ROCm 6.3 includes RDC with the correct version number.
See [GitHub issue #4089](https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/issues/4089).

```{important}
If you're using RHEL9, you must first uninstall the existing ROCm 6.2 RDC 1.0.0 package with `sudo yum
remove rdc` before upgrading to the ROCm 6.3 RDC package `sudo yum install rdc`.
```

### ROCm Validation Suite needs specified configuration file

ROCm Validation Suite might fail for certain platforms if executed without the `-c` option and
specifying the configuration file. See [RVS command line
options](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/ROCmValidationSuite/en/docs-6.3.0/ug1main.html#command-line-options)
for more information. This issue will be addressed in a future release.
See [GitHub issue #4090](https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/issues/4090).

## ROCm resolved issues

The following are previously known issues resolved in this release. For resolved issues related to
individual components, review the [Detailed component changes](#detailed-component-changes).

### Bandwidth limitation in gang and non-gang modes on Instinct MI300A

Fixed an issue where expected target peak non-gang performance (~60 GB/s) and target peak gang
performance (~90 GB/s) were not achieved. Previously, both gang and non-gang performance were
observed to be limited at 45 GB/s. See [issue #3496](https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/issues/3496) on
GitHub.

## ROCm upcoming changes

The following changes to the ROCm software stack are anticipated for future releases.

### AMDGPU wavefront size compiler macro deprecation

The `__AMDGCN_WAVEFRONT_SIZE__` macro is deprecated and support will be removed in an upcoming
release. It is recommended that any use of this macro be removed. For more information, see [AMDGPU
support](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/llvm-project/en/docs-6.3.0/LLVM/clang/html/AMDGPUSupport.html).

### HIPCC Perl scripts deprecation

The HIPCC Perl scripts (`hipcc.pl` and `hipconfig.pl`) will be removed in an upcoming release.
