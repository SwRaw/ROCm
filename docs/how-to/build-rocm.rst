Build ROCm from source
*************************************************************

ROCm is an open-source stack from which you can build from source code. The source code is available from `<https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm>`__.


The general steps to build ROCm are:

#. Clone the ROCm source code
#. Prepare the build environment
#. Run the build command

Because the ROCm stack is constantly evolving, the most current instructions are stored with the source code in GitHub.  
For detailed build instructions, see `Build ROCm from source <https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm?tab=readme-ov-file#build-rocm-from-source>`_
