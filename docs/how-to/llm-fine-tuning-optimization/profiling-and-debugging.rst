Profiling and debugging
***********************

This section provides an index for further documentation on  profiling and
debugging tools and their common usage patterns.

See :ref:`AMD Instinct MI300Xâ„¢ workload optimization <mi300x-profiling-start>`
for a conceptual summary of the workload profiling workflow for ROCm applications
on AMD hardware -- including fine-tuning LLMs.

There, you'll find information on higher-level and kernel-level profiling tools
as well as other profiling and debugging suggestions.
